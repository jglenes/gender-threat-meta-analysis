This is the repository for a meta-analysis of gender threat effects.

These search terms are nice, but yeild far too many results.  Let's see if we can't wittle them down.  I don't think it's really necessary to have "Feedback" and "Challenge" in there.  They won't turn up any additional articles we are missing.

* [(Masculinity OR Femininity OR Manhood OR Womanhood OR Gender) AND Threat](http://goo.gl/p3OAd): 1,592 Results
* [(Masculinity OR Femininity OR Manhood OR Womanhood OR Gender) AND (Threat OR Violations)](http://goo.gl/nrVvy): 2167 Results

I think this one is fair, yields a manageable amount of results, and will be persuasive to reviewers. This would be my recommendation for search terms:

* [(Masculinity OR Femininity OR Manhood OR Womanhood OR Gender Role) AND (Threat OR Violations)](http://goo.gl/Uu0si): 417 Results

## Paper Framing Ideas

One of the goals of this research should be to address criticisms that "Womanhood is not precarious,"  and to differentiate threats to manhood status from gender role violations for women.  Specifically, we should seek to address the questions:  

* Can womanhood be threatened? If so, how?
* Are threats to womanhood gender status threats or merely gender role violations?
* Are threats to manhood similar to threats to womanhood in any way (e.g., body image concerns?)

The meta-analysis should not only attempt to provide a meta-analytic examination of gender threat effects, and test the theoretical components of Precarious Manhood Theory, but it should also address some of the critiques put forth in the PMM special issue.

## Working Definition of Gender Threat

* An event that indicates that one's gender, gender status, gender identity, gender role, or sexual orientation does not match one's perceived or expected gender, gender status, gender identity, gender role or sexual orientation.
* The self-perception of one's own behavior that would cause a real or imagined other to perceive your gender, gender status, gender identity, gender role, or sexual orientation as 

## Inclusion Criteria

* Must include a threat condition where participants receive negative feedback about their gender, gender status, gender identity, or sexual orientation. 
* Must include either (or both) a condition in which participants receive positive (consistent) feedback about their gender, gender status, gender identity, or sexual orientation or a condition in which participants receive neutral feedback that is unrelated to their gender, gender status, gender identity, or sexual orientation.
* May also include studies in which participants recall past experiences of these threats.
* Must include information sufficient for an effect size to be calculated separately for men and women.
* Studies that only include either men or women will only contribute a single effect size to the meta-analysis.

## Moderators

* Threat Publicity (Public vs. Private)
* Sample (Student vs. other)
* Gender role identification, collective self-esteem
* Outcome (Affect, Behavior, Cognition -- implicit, explicit?)
* Experimenter gender (Men vs. Women vs. Both)
